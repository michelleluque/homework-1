# The age of Etransfers

## Overview and Origin

The company I have chosen is Venmo. It was incoporated in the year 2009 and has been owned by paypal since 2013. The company was founded by Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail. The pair were college roommates at the University of Pennsylvania. The creation of venmo began as a music start up but then took a pivot after an encounter the two men had. After having a weekend visit with each other, one of them forgot their wallet. From here, they realized the difficulty and complexity with checks and transferring money the old fashioned way. This then propelled them into creating an easier way to transfer money electronically. The company did not need much funding as one of the two boys majored in computer science and was able to establish a lot of the programming himself. After exponential growth, the company then started to incorporate investors.


## Business Activities:

One of the main goals of the company was to create an easier, simpler, and quicker way to transfer money between individuals. Venmo seems to intend a direction towards younger demographics in its customer base, specifically gen z and millenials. As of 2022, venmo has registered 77.7 million active users. Venmo has flourished and been successful because of its ease of trasnfer and its security backing. Since the rise of Venmo, many competitors have tried establishing as much success but have not gotten close. An exampl would be the app Cashapp. Though serving similar functions, cashapp lacks a customer support department and has little security backing transfers. This means if a money transfer goes incorrectly, that could be lost money that the user man never be able to recooperate. This is different then venmo which has a very useful customer service department and internal investigation team for when issues arise. 

Some technologies currently being used by venmo consist of: HTML5, JQuery, and google annalytics. These technologies aid in the accessibility and appearance of the app.

## Landscape:

Venmo falls under the payments and remittances domain. Some successful trends within this domain consist of digital money transfers, purchasing items and then paying later in increments, and cryptocurrencies. Some examples of other companies in this domain would be Zelle, afterpay, and dogecoin. 

## Results

The efficiency and quickness of companies in the payments domain has allowed businesses to thrive. Venmo's best feature that has allowed business success has been the ability to link business accounts to the app as well. This then allows for a greater influx of business since greater amount of accessibility to a greater demographic. Some metrics that could be used to measure performance in this domain would be total users and total revenue. Venmo has 77.7 million users and $935 million in revenue. Compared to other companies in this domain, venmo is performing exceptionally well and maintains its position of being one of the leading apps.
